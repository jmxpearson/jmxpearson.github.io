<img src="https://octodex.github.com/images/steroidtocat.png" height="150px" style="float:left; margin-right: 20px"/> As of today, this blog has moved to GitHub pages, where I can take advantage of Jekyll to write posts in glorious low-tech Markdown. Plus equations \\(\nabla \cdot \mathbf{B} = 0\\) ! And code:
{% highlight python %}
def get_crunk():
    print "hello, cleveland!"
    break_everything()
{% endhighlight %}
This is almost embarrassingly exciting.
