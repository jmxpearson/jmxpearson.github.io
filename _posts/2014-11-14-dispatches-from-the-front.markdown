I'm at Day 2 of the second [Human Single Unit](http://www.humansingleunit.org/) conference, this time held at Johns Hopkins. It's been a strong program, and inspiring, given that I'm trying to get a related manuscript of my own out the door. Highlights from today:

* Kahana lab apparently posts its [raw data](http://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Electrophysiological_Data) online for others to analyze. Mad respect. Would love to do this eventually. Human data of of this kind are so rare that we shouldn't be hoarding.

* Itzhak Fried saying that, "Everyone knows that about the minimum it takes to publish one of these single unit human studies is 3 -- 5 years." Well, I didn't know when I started, but that's turning out to be a pretty accurate time frame. This is what you don't read about in the papers: the time, technical challenges, and frustrations. But man, oh, man, is the good stuff in this vein cool.

* Another gem from Dr. Fried (loosely paraphrased): "Typically, as a physiologist, you have a question, then you put an electrode into the brain. In this work, you have an electrode, and you have to ask a question. And not a boring question, or a stupid question, because it's going to take you a long time to answer it."
