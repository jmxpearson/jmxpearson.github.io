Courtesy of Randall Munroe’s [xkcd](http://xkcd.com/1133/) and Theo Sanderson’s handy [text editor][ted], a description of what I do using only the ten hundred most common words:

> I’m trying to understand how the brain works. I want to know how people decide what to do and how they change their minds. I want to understand how they learn new things and how they change plans when the world changes around them.
>
> I do this because I want to help people with brain problems get better. Lots of people with brain problems have trouble deciding. Sometimes, they can’t control what they think, or they can’t say no to something they want that’s bad for them. By figuring out how brains work, we can help them.
>
> I also use numbers. A lot.
