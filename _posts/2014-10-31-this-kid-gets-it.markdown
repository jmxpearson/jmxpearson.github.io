From an undergraduate at my institution who was selected as a BRAIN Initiative Grand Challenge Scholar and [interviewed on whitehouse.gov](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2014/10/09/brain-initiative-and-grand-challenge-scholars):

> **Kevin:** The best way to become a valuable member in nearly any scientific field is to learn to code. Software developers are needed across all types of industry (private, university, government). It has been my experience that nearly every lab could use another pair of hands to perform data analysis or machine learning techniques that you can learn with at least some coding background.  There are practically an infinite number of ways to learn to code, most of them you can do in your free time.
