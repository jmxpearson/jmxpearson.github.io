So this is my blog. I’ll be writing about brain science and data, and posting whatever I produce (pubs, code, presentations) that may be of use to someone else.

A quick couple of notes: comments are off by default. Unless I’m calling on the wisdom of the void, I don’t need the headache. Also, the views expressed here are entirely my own.

Thanks for reading.
