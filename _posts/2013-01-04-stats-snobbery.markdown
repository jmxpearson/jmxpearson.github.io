Sean Taylor has a great post up about [what your choice of stats software says about you](http://seanjtaylor.com/post/39573264781/the-statistics-software-signal). Some of it’s a little harsh, and it’s all tongue-in-cheek, but I do have to admit to doing this sort of profiling. Graphs made in Excel do not exactly inspire confidence in yours truly.
