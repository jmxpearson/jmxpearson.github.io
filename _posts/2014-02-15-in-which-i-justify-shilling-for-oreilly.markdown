Given that I have proven almost wholly incapable of sustaining a blog, it might come as a surprise to my “legions” of readers that I would break a long silence just to start posting book reviews. Programming book reviews at that.

Well, I joined the [O’Reilly Blogger Review Program](http://oreilly.com/bloggers/). This means they give me free books, and I’m required to post reviews. I am not required to make them positive, be funny, be insightful, or guarantee your happiness.

So be forewarned that any book reviews you see me posting are not simply out of the goodness of my heart. The relevant posts will, however, come with a disclaimer, and I will be giving my real opinion. I tend to buy a lot of O’Reilly books, and it’s certainly not a stretch to believe I like some of them.

That is all. Carry on.
