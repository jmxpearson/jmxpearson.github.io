# About this blog:

Cognitive, systems, and decision neuroscience. Machine learning and data analysis. Python, R, and Matlab. Brain-related items of public interest from an insider’s view.

# About me:
<img src="{{site.dukeurl}}/assets/john_photo_mini.jpg" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px"/>  I’m a research scientist in the [Duke Institute for Brain Sciences](http://www.dibs.duke.edu/) and the [Center for Cognitive Neuroscience](http://www.mind.duke.edu/). My research focuses on applying methods from machine learning to brain data, in which capacity I collaborate with faculty in the [Duke Statistical Machine Learning Group](https://web.duke.edu/statml/) and the [Information Initiative at Duke](http://bigdata.duke.edu/).

I also have a special interest in the neurobiology of reward and decision-making, particularly issues of impulsivity and self-control. My first love (and training) was physics, so I like to make things quantitative when I can. Finally, I'm fascinated by animal behavior and approaches to neuroscience based on natural tasks like foraging, mate selection, and collective decision making.
