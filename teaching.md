I'm passionate about teaching statistical and computing skills to students in the biological sciences. Despite the fact that programming and data analysis consume an increasing chunk of most scientists' time, few undergraduates receive any formal training beyond an obligatory introduction to the t-test and ANOVA. 

At Duke I've conducted several programming classes and workshops aimed at graduate students and postdocs. The online notes for one of them, an introduction to Matlab, are available [here](http://www.duke.edu/~jmp33/matlab).

More recently, I've gotten involved with [Software Carpentry](http://www.software-carpentry.org), a nonprofit dedicated to teaching computing skills to scientists. Sofware Carpentry is really unique, in my view, for its emphasis on [evidence-based pedagogy](http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/materials). To this end, I've recently become a [certified instructor](http://software-carpentry.org/badges/instructor.html): ![](http://software-carpentry.org/img/badges/instructor.png)

## Courses
Notes from the Python section of my recent class for Duke undergraduates are available [here](https://github.com/jmxpearson/DIBS_materials). Or view them on [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/jmxpearson/DIBS_materials/tree/master/python/).

Notes from my previous Matlab class are online [here](http://www.duke.edu/~jmp33/matlab).
